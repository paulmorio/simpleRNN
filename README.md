# SimpleRNN

This is a repository containing minimal examples of RNN architectures for expositional purposes and use in class, much of this work is built on the shoulders of giants such M. Nielsen and A. Karpathy.

## Pre-requisites
Python, all versions 2.5x+ should work. Most of the code will be written for 2.7.12 however care has been put in so that it should run inside of 3.2+ with little to no alteration.

## Motivation
Reviewing Key Concepts and Preparing materials to teach in Class.

## Currently included:
For character level text generation.
- Vanilla RNN implementation
- Vanilla LSTM
